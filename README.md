# TestObjectService - School project

The TestObjectService is the service responsible for handling CRUD operations related to new test objects. It is part of a microservices application including [GatewayService](https://github.com/olavlinddam/GatewayService) and [LeakTestService](https://github.com/olavlinddam/LeakTestService). The services are containerized and set up as a Docker Swarm to ensure stability and high availability. They communicate via RabbitMQ which makes the application services highly decoupled.

This service was initially developed as part of a larger school project in collaboration with [Nolek](https://nolek.dk/). The project's objective was to create a prototype application that companies could use to store and retrieve data related to leak tests on various objects.
